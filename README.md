# BMI-Calculator

I have added two text fields with placeholder text:

Weight (kg)
Height (m)
One label for the answer, which  include the units (kg/m²)
One button to do the calculation.
The formula used is BMI = weight in kg / (height in m)²
I have added added a switch that toggles between metric 
and imperial units for the input.
